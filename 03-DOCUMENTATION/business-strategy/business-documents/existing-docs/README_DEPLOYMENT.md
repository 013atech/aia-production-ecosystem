# 🚀 AIA System v3.0 Deployment Instructions

## Created Deployment Script

I've created a comprehensive deployment script: `deploy-aia-v3.sh`

## ⚡ Quick Deployment

**To deploy AIA System v3.0 to production, run:**

```bash
./deploy-aia-v3.sh
```

## 📋 What the Script Does

### 1. **Prerequisites Check**
- ✅ Validates git, gh CLI, kubectl installation
- ✅ Checks GitHub authentication
- ✅ Verifies repository structure

### 2. **System Validation**
- ✅ Tests required files exist
- ✅ Validates Python imports
- ✅ Checks system readiness

### 3. **Deployment Execution**
- ✅ Stages and commits changes
- ✅ Pushes to main branch (triggers GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Monitors deployment progress

### 4. **Real-time Monitoring**
- ✅ Watches GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Shows live deployment logs
- ✅ Monitors Kubernetes rollout

### 5. **Validation Testing**
- ✅ Tests production endpoints
- ✅ Validates health checks
- ✅ Measures response times

## 🎯 Expected Output

## 🔧 Manual Steps (if script can't run)

If you can't run the script, execute these commands manually:

```bash
# 1. Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "feat: AIA System v3.0 production deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Monitor  
gh run watch

# 3. Validate
curl -f https://013a.tech/health
```

## 📊 Deployment Timeline

- **Minutes 0-5**: Testing and validation
- **Minutes 5-10**: Docker build and push
- **Minutes 10-20**: Kubernetes deployment
- **Minutes 20-25**: Health checks and validation
- **Total**: ~25 minutes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**I cannot actually run this script** - you must execute it in your terminal. I can only:
- ✅ Create scripts and files
- ✅ Help interpret results 
- ✅ Troubleshoot issues
- ❌ Execute commands directly
- ❌ Push to repositories
- ❌ Monitor deployments in real-time

## 🚀 Next Step

**Execute the deployment:**
```bash
./deploy-aia-v3.sh
```

Then share the output with me if you need help with any issues!
