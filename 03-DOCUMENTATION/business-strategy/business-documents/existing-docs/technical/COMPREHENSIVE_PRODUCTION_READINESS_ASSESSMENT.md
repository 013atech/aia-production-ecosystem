## Final Deployment Decision

**CONDITIONAL GO FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

The 013a Analytics system demonstrates strong technical architecture and implementation quality. The React frontend with Three.js 3D visualization is production-ready with excellent performance characteristics. The FastAPI backend provides robust API functionality with proper security measures.

**However, the system requires immediate attention to monitoring infrastructure before production deployment. The absence of Prometheus and Grafana monitoring creates a critical operational blind spot that must be addressed.**

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus and Grafana monitoring stack
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates for all production endpoints
- [ ] Fix SQLAlchemy table conflicts in test environment
- [ ] Install missing Python dependencies (semver, python-magic)
- [ ] Verify all health checks are responding correctly
- [ ] Confirm backup and recovery procedures are operational

**Recommended Deployment Timeline**: 48 hours after monitoring infrastructure deployment and verification.
