## LAUNCH READINESS DECISION

### ❌ **NOT READY FOR FULL PRODUCTION LAUNCH**

**Primary Blockers**:
1. **Security System Failure** - Cannot launch without enterprise security
2. **Enterprise Integration Failure** - $25M+ partner integrations non-functional
3. **Business Intelligence Offline** - Core business metrics unavailable
4. **Payment System Failure** - Revenue systems non-operational

### 🟡 **CONDITIONAL LAUNCH SCENARIOS**

#### Scenario A: Limited Beta Launch (Possible)
- **Scope**: Knowledge graph and basic analytics only
- **Requirements**: Fix npm vulnerabilities first
- **Risk**: Limited functionality, no enterprise features

#### Scenario B: Internal Testing Phase (Recommended)
- **Scope**: Full system with mocked enterprise services
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks for critical fixes
- **Success Criteria**: All red/yellow components moved to green
