## ✨ What This Script Does

The `automated-cloudshell-deployment.sh` script **fully automates** the entire deployment using `gcloud` CLI:

1. ✅ **Verifies Prerequisites**
   - Checks gcloud CLI installation
   - Validates GitHub CLI (gh)
   - Confirms tarball exists and integrity
   - Tests Cloud Shell connectivity
   - Starts Cloud Shell if needed

2. ✅ **Uploads Tarball**
   - Uses `gcloud cloud-shell scp` to upload 82MB tarball
   - Verifies upload integrity with MD5 checksum
   - Confirms file size matches

3. ✅ **Executes Deployment**
   - Creates deployment script remotely
   - Runs commands in Cloud Shell via SSH
   - Extracts files
   - Commits changes
   - Pushes to GitHub
   - Creates tag v1.0.0
   - Publishes GitHub release

4. ✅ **Verifies Success**
   - Confirms release is live
   - Checks tag exists on remote
   - Validates latest commit
   - Opens release URL

5. ✅ **Cleans Up**
   - Removes temporary files from Cloud Shell
   - Cleans local temp files

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (One Command!)

```bash
./automated-cloudshell-deployment.sh
```

**That's it!** The entire deployment happens automatically in 2-4 minutes.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Tools

1. **gcloud CLI** (Google Cloud SDK)
   ```bash
   # Check if installed
   gcloud --version
   
   # If not installed, get it from:
   # https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   ```

2. **GitHub CLI** (gh)
   ```bash
   # Check if installed
   gh --version
   
   # If not installed:
   brew install gh          # macOS
   # or visit: https://cli.github.com/
   ```

3. **gcloud Authentication**
   ```bash
   # Login if needed
   gcloud auth login
   
   # Verify
   gcloud auth list
   ```

4. **GitHub Authentication** (should already be done)
   ```bash
   # Verify
   gh auth status
   ```

### Required Files

- ✅ `~/aia-local-changes.tar.gz` (should already exist, 82 MB)
- ✅ `automated-cloudshell-deployment.sh` (this script)

## 🎬 Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Prerequisites Check (10 seconds)
```
🔐 Cryptography Agent: Verifying authentication
⚙️  DevOps Engineer: Testing Cloud Shell connectivity
✅ Production Readiness: Validating tarball integrity
```

The script verifies:
- ✅ gcloud CLI installed
- ✅ GitHub CLI installed
- ✅ Tarball exists (82 MB)
- ✅ MD5 checksum (20d98fe3a38d554510f6dc7722afc7b5)
- ✅ gcloud authenticated
- ✅ Cloud Shell accessible

### Phase 1: Upload Tarball (30-60 seconds)
```
⚙️  DevOps Engineer: Uploading via gcloud SCP
✅ Production Readiness: Verifying upload integrity
```

Uses `gcloud cloud-shell scp` to transfer the 82MB tarball to Cloud Shell.

### Phase 2: Execute Deployment (60-120 seconds)
```
🔐 Cryptography Agent: Creating deployment script
⚙️  DevOps Engineer: Executing remote commands
```

The script automatically:
- Navigates to ~/aia
- Fetches latest from remote
- Extracts tarball contents (2,394 files)
- Stages all changes
- Creates production commit
- Pushes to GitHub main
- Creates tag v1.0.0
- Pushes tag
- Creates GitHub release with RELEASE_NOTES_V1.0.0.md

### Phase 3: Verify Deployment (10 seconds)
```
✅ Production Readiness: Verifying deployment
📦 Release Manager: Checking GitHub release
🎓 Technical Lead: Validating commit history
```

Confirms:
- ✅ Release v1.0.0 is live on GitHub
- ✅ Tag exists on remote
- ✅ Latest commit matches

### Phase 4: Cleanup (5 seconds)
```
⚙️  DevOps Engineer: Removing temporary files
```

Removes:
- ~/aia-local-changes.tar.gz (from Cloud Shell)
- ~/cloudshell-deploy.sh (from Cloud Shell)
- /tmp/cloudshell-deploy.sh (local)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "gcloud: command not found"
**Solution**: Install Google Cloud SDK
```bash
# macOS
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk

# Or download from:
# https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
```

### Issue: "Cloud Shell not accessible"
**Solution**: Ensure Cloud Shell is enabled in your GCP project
```bash
# Open Cloud Shell manually first:
open https://console.cloud.google.com

# Click the Cloud Shell icon (top-right)
# Wait for it to start, then retry the script
```

### Issue: "Upload failed"
**Solution**: Check network connection and Cloud Shell status
```bash
# Test Cloud Shell manually
gcloud cloud-shell ssh --command="echo test"

# If that works, retry the script
```

### Issue: "Push rejected (diverged history)"
**Solution**: The script handles this automatically with `git pull`, but if it fails:
```bash
# Run this in Cloud Shell manually:
gcloud cloud-shell ssh

# Then in Cloud Shell:
cd ~/aia
git fetch origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
tar -xzf ~/aia-local-changes.tar.gz -C ~/aia
git add -A
git commit -m "Deploy AIA v1.0.0"
git push origin main --force
```

### Issue: "gh: command not found" in Cloud Shell
**Solution**: The script will install it automatically, but if needed:
```bash
# In Cloud Shell:
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
gh auth login
```
