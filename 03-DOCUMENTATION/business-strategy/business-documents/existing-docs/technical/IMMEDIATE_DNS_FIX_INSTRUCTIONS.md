## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update Cloudflare DNS Records

**Login to Cloudflare Dashboard** → Navigate to `013a.tech` → DNS Records

**Replace current A records with**:

```
Type: A | Name: @          | Value: 34.120.153.135 | TTL: Auto | Proxy: ✅ Proxied
Type: A | Name: www        | Value: 34.120.153.135 | TTL: Auto | Proxy: ✅ Proxied
Type: A | Name: api        | Value: 34.120.153.135 | TTL: Auto | Proxy: ✅ Proxied
```

### Step 2: Immediate Verification

**Test directly** (should work immediately):
```bash
curl -H "Host: 013a.tech" http://34.120.153.135/
curl -H "Host: api.013a.tech" http://34.120.153.135/health
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "AIA Analytics API v3.0 - Production Ready",
  "status": "operational",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T00:27:24.417580",
  "features": [
    "Real-time Analytics",
    "ML Processing Engine",
    "Cognitive Computing",
    "Enterprise Security",
    "WebSocket Support"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: SSL Certificate Automatic Provisioning

**After DNS update** (5-15 minutes):
- Google Managed Certificates will automatically validate
- SSL status will change from `FailedNotVisible` to `Active`
- HTTPS endpoints will become operational
- 522 error will be resolved

### Step 4: Final Verification

**Once DNS propagates** (10-30 minutes total):
- ✅ `https://013a.tech` → Beautiful enterprise frontend
- ✅ `https://api.013a.tech/health` → API health status
- ✅ `https://www.013a.tech` → Redirects properly

## 📊 Current Infrastructure Status
