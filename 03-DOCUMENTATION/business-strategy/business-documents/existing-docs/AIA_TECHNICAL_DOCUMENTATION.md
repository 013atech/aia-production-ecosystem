**Three.js 0.180.0 + React Three Fiber 8.17.10**: Industry-leading 3D graphics library integrated with React for creating immersive business analytics environments. Supports WebGL 2.0 and WebXR for VR/AR capabilities.

```typescript
// Core 3D Architecture Pattern
interface Immersive3DEnvironment {
  scene: THREE.Scene;
  camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
  renderer: THREE.WebGLRenderer;
  controls: OrbitControls;
  physics: CannonWorld;
  xr: XRSession;
}

// Data Visualization in 3D Space
interface DataVisualization3D {
  dataPoints: Vector3[];
  visualizationType: 'scatter' | 'network' | 'flow' | 'heatmap';
  interactionMode: 'hover' | 'click' | 'gesture' | 'voice';
  animationState: AnimationMixer;
}
```

### 2.2 3D Immersive Interface Justification

### 2.3 State Management Architecture

**Dual State Management**: Redux Toolkit for global application state, Zustand for component-local state to optimize performance in complex 3D environments.

```typescript
// Redux Store Architecture
interface AiaRootState {
  auth: AuthState;           // JWT authentication & user session
  mcp: MCPState;            // Model Control Protocol orchestration
  agents: AgentSystemState; // Multi-agent coordination
  economics: TokenState;    // Dual-token system management
  threejs: Scene3DState;    // 3D environment state
  ui: UserInterfaceState;   // Theme, navigation, preferences
}

// Zustand Stores for Performance-Critical Components
const useThreeJSStore = create<ThreeJSStore>((set, get) => ({
  scene: null,
  camera: null,
  renderer: null,
  updateScene: (newScene) => set({ scene: newScene }),
  optimizePerformance: () => {
    // GPU-based optimization logic
  }
}));
```

**Context System**: Multiple React contexts handle specialized concerns:
- `MCPContext`: Model Control Protocol request orchestration
- `AuthContext`: JWT authentication and role-based access control
- `ThemeContext`: Dark theme with cyan-to-lemon gradient system
- `ThreeJSContext`: 3D scene management and WebXR state
- `EconomicContext`: Token balance, transactions, governance voting

### 2.4 Material-UI Design System

**Enterprise Design Language**: Custom Material-UI theme implementing AIA's design system:

```typescript
const aiaTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'dark',
    primary: {
      main: '#1E1E1E', // Deep charcoal background
      light: 'linear-gradient(45deg, #00FFFF, #FFFF00)', // Cyan-to-lemon gradient
    },
    background: {
      default: '#1E1E1E',
      paper: '#2A2A2A',
    },
    text: {
      primary: '#F5F5DC', // Ivory text for optimal contrast
    }
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif', // Clean geometric sans-serif
  },
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          borderRadius: '24px', // Pill-shaped buttons
          textTransform: 'none',
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

```python
# Core Service Structure
class AiaBaseService:
    """Base service class with common functionality"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = structlog.get_logger()
        self.metrics = PrometheusMetrics()
        self.crypto = ProductionCryptography()
        self.circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker()

    async def health_check(self) -> ServiceHealth:
        """Standard health check implementation"""
        pass

# Primary Services
services = {
    "mcp_orchestrator": MCPOrchestratorService,     # Model Control Protocol
    "agent_system": MultiAgentSystemService,       # Agent coordination
    "economic_engine": EconomicEngineService,       # Token system

}
```

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Orchestration (MCP Protocol)

**Model Control Protocol**: The MCP is AIA's proprietary orchestration protocol that manages the lifecycle of analytical requests through a multi-agent system.

**Agent Specialization**:
```python
class AgentCapabilities(Enum):
    DATA_ACQUISITION = "data_acquisition"      # Research API integration
    FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS = "financial_analysis"  # Financial modeling
    MARKET_RESEARCH = "market_research"       # Competitive intelligence
    RISK_ASSESSMENT = "risk_assessment"       # Risk modeling
    VISUALIZATION = "visualization"           # Chart and graph generation
    REPORT_WRITING = "report_writing"        # Natural language generation
    SLIDE_DESIGN = "slide_design"            # Presentation creation
    DASHBOARD_BUILD = "dashboard_building"    # Interactive dashboard assembly
    QUALITY_ASSURANCE = "quality_assurance"   # Output validation
    PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION = "optimization" # System performance tuning
```

    def __init__(self):
        # Hybrid classical/post-quantum key exchange
        self.kyber_kem = EnterpriseKyberKEM(KyberSecurityLevel.KYBER_1024)
        self.classical_crypto = Ed25519PrivateKey.generate()

        # Zero-knowledge proof systems
        self.zkp_manager = EnterpriseZKPManager()

        # Hardware Security Module integration
        self.hsm_manager = EnterpriseHSMManager()

    async def hybrid_encrypt(self, data: bytes, recipient_public_key: bytes) -> HybridCiphertext:
        """Combines classical and post-quantum encryption"""
        # Use both ECDH and Kyber KEM for forward security
        pass

    async def generate_zkp_proof(self, circuit: CircuitType, private_inputs: Dict) -> ZKProof:
        """Generate zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving computations"""
        pass
```

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enable privacy-preserving analytics where users can prove insights without revealing underlying data:

    def __init__(self):
        self.utility_token = AIAToken()           # System usage and payments
        self.governance_token = AIAGovToken()     # Governance and staking
        self.treasury = TreasuryManager()         # Multi-signature treasury
        self.consensus = ConsensusMechanism()     # Governance voting

    async def process_agent_rewards(self, performance_data: AgentPerformanceData):
        """Distribute rewards based on agent performance"""
        # Performance-based token distribution
        # Automated market maker integration
        # Staking rewards calculation
        pass

    async def governance_proposal(self, proposal: GovernanceProposal) -> ProposalResult:
        """Handle governance proposals with advanced voting mechanisms"""
        # Quadratic voting, conviction voting, liquid democracy
        pass
```

**Economic Mechanisms**:
- Performance-based reward distribution to agents and developers
- Automated market making for token liquidity
- Governance mechanisms including quadratic voting and conviction voting
- Treasury management with multi-signature controls

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Primary transactional data
-- User accounts, authentication, system configuration
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(50),
    token_balance DECIMAL(18,8)
);

-- TimescaleDB: Time-series performance data
