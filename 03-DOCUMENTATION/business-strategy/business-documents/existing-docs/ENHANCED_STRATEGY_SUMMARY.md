# Enhanced AIA-Only Deployment Strategy Summary

## 🎯 Core Enhancement: Repository Code Enforcement

The strategy has been **enhanced** to ensure that not only are non-AIA systems removed, but **all remaining AIA services run the exact code from the current repository state** - no old versions allowed.

## 🔧 New Capabilities

### 1. **Version Drift Detection**
```bash
# Automatically detects when AIA services are running outdated code
./scripts/version-manager.sh status
./scripts/version-manager.sh check-drift
```

**Example Output:**
```
Current deployed versions:
Repository version: v1.2.3-dev.2.abc1234

  aia-api:        v1.2.2-dev.1.def5678 (DRIFT DETECTED)
  aia-frontend:   v1.2.3-dev.2.abc1234 (CURRENT)
  aia-orchestrator: v1.2.1 (DRIFT DETECTED)

❌ Version drift detected! Some AIA services are not running current repository code.
```

### 2. **Automatic Repository Sync**
```bash
# Forces all AIA services to run current repository code
./scripts/version-manager.sh sync-repo-code
./deploy-aia-only.sh sync-repo
```

**What it does:**
- Builds missing images for current repository version
- Updates all AIA deployments to use current code
- Waits for successful rollouts
- Verifies sync completion

### 3. **Aggressive Version Cleanup**
```bash
# Keeps only the 3 most recent AIA versions (configurable)
./scripts/version-manager.sh cleanup-old-versions 3
```

**Benefits:**
- Removes old AIA versions that shouldn't be running
- Prevents accidental deployment of outdated code
- Reduces registry storage costs
- Maintains clean version history

## 🚀 Enhanced Deployment Process

### Comprehensive Cleanup Now Includes:

1. ✅ **Remove non-AIA systems** (namespaces, images, resources)
2. ✅ **Remove non-AIA images** from registry
3. ✅ **Clean up old AIA versions** (keeps only recent ones)
4. ✅ **Sync all AIA services** to current repository code
5. ✅ **Verify repository alignment** (no version drift)

### Enhanced Cloud Build Pipeline:

The `cloudbuild-aia-only.yaml` now includes:
- **Step 13: Sync AIA services to repository code**
- Automatic detection of version drift
- Force update of services running old code
- Verification that all services match repository state

## 🎯 Policy Enforcement

### **Original Policy:**
> Only AIA system resources should exist in GCP

### **Enhanced Policy:**
> 1. Only AIA system resources should exist in GCP  
> 2. **All AIA services must run the exact code from the current repository state**

## 📋 New Commands Available

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `check-drift` | Detect if AIA services are running current repository code |
| `sync-repo-code` | Force all AIA services to current repository version |
| `cleanup-old-versions [n]` | Aggressively clean old AIA versions (keep n recent) |

## 🔄 Typical Usage Flow

### 1. **Daily Status Check**
```bash
./scripts/version-manager.sh status
```
- Shows all deployed versions
- **Automatically detects version drift**
- Warns if services are not running current code

### 2. **After Code Changes**
```bash
# Deploy new code
./deploy-aia-only.sh deploy

# OR: Just sync existing services to current code
./deploy-aia-only.sh sync-repo
```

### 3. **Periodic Maintenance**
```bash
# Full cleanup including repository sync
./scripts/version-manager.sh full-cleanup
```

## ✅ Final Result

After implementation, your GCP environment will:

1. ✅ **Contain ONLY AIA system resources** (no foreign systems)
2. ✅ **Run ONLY current repository code** (no old versions)
3. ✅ **Use semantic versioning** (no misleading "latest" tags)
4. ✅ **Automatically detect code drift** (version mismatch alerts)
5. ✅ **Support safe rollbacks** (with version history)
6. ✅ **Maintain clean infrastructure** (automated cleanup)

## 🎉 Key Benefits

### **Eliminates Common Problems:**
- ❌ Services running old code after repository updates
- ❌ Version confusion ("which code is actually running?")
- ❌ Gradual drift between repository and deployed state
- ❌ Accumulation of unused old versions
- ❌ Non-AIA systems interfering with operations

### **Ensures:**
- ✅ **Code freshness**: All services always run current repository code
- ✅ **Environment clarity**: Exactly what's in the repository is deployed
- ✅ **Version transparency**: Clear mapping between git commits and deployments
- ✅ **Clean infrastructure**: Only necessary resources exist
- ✅ **Predictable behavior**: No surprises from old versions

---

**The enhanced strategy now provides complete control over both WHAT systems exist (AIA-only) and WHICH CODE they're running (repository-current only).**
