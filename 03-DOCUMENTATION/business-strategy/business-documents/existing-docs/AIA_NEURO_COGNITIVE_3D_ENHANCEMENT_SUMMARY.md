    .slice(0, Math.floor(20 * (1 - cognitiveState.cognitiveLoad)));
}
```

### 2. **Emotionally Adaptive 3D Environments**

## Integration with AIA Systems

### MCP (Model Control Protocol) Integration

The neuro-cognitive system seamlessly integrates with existing AIA infrastructure:

```typescript
// MCP activity influences particle behavior
const mcpInfluence = mcpActivity.systemActivity * 0.15;
particle.velocity.multiplyScalar(1 + mcpInfluence);

// Agent communications create spatial relationships
if (mcpActivity.agentCommunications) {
  const commDirection = calculateCommunicationDirection();
  particle.velocity.add(commDirection.multiplyScalar(0.1));
}
```

### AI-Powered Adaptation

**Cognitive Recommendation System**:
```typescript
const generateCognitiveRecommendations = (metrics, state) => {
  if (metrics.cognitiveLoad > 0.7) return "Reduce visual complexity";
  if (metrics.attentionLevel < 0.5) return "Increase visual prominence";
  if (metrics.fatigue > 0.6) return "Consider taking a break";
  // ... additional AI-driven recommendations
};
```
