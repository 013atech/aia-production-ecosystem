      type: 'PROCESS_COGNITIVE_DATA',
      data: data
    });
  }

  optimizeVisualization(cognitiveLoad: number): RenderingConfig {

    return {
      particleCount: Math.max(100, 1000 - (cognitiveLoad * 500)),
      shadowQuality: cognitiveLoad < 0.7 ? 'high' : 'medium',
      animationComplexity: cognitiveLoad < 0.5 ? 'full' : 'reduced'
    };
  }
}
```

        self.ml_model_pool = ModelPool(min_instances=5, max_instances=50)
        self.event_streaming = KafkaProducer()

    async def process_biometric_stream(self, user_id: str, data_stream: AsyncIterator):
        # Real-time processing with auto-scaling
        async for data_point in data_stream:
            cognitive_state = await self.ml_model_pool.predict(data_point)
            await self.redis_client.setex(f"cognitive:{user_id}", 60, cognitive_state)
