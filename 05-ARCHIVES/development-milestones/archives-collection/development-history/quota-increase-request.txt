PROJECT: aia-system-prod-1759055445
REGION: us-central1
DATE: 2025-10-08
URGENCY: CRITICAL - Production Deployment Blocked

QUOTA INCREASE REQUESTS:
========================

1. CPUS (Regional - us-central1)
   Current Limit: 200
   Requested Limit: 500
   Justification: Production deployment of AIA Enterprise Platform requires 25 nodes with 4 vCPUs each (100 vCPUs) 
                  plus headroom for auto-scaling and high availability (3x multiplier = 300 vCPUs).
                  Additional 200 vCPUs reserved for staging/development environments.
                  Current usage: 32/200 but all 8 cluster nodes maxed at 72-99% CPU utilization.
                  32 pods currently pending due to insufficient CPU resources.
   Business Impact: Blocking revenue-generating platform from serving customers. 
                    Estimated revenue impact: $50,000/month delayed.
                    Fortune 500 partnerships (EY Global, JPMorgan Chase, Google Cloud, Apple) at risk.

2. IN_USE_ADDRESSES (Regional - us-central1)
   Current Limit: 8
   Requested Limit: 20
   Justification: Each load balancer requires 1 IP address. Currently at 8/8 (100% capacity).
                  Required IPs:
                  - Main production ingress load balancer: 1 (BLOCKED - cannot provision)
                  - Regional load balancers for high availability: 3
                  - Service external IPs for partner integrations: 6
                  - Staging and development environments: 5
                  - Future expansion buffer: 5
                  Total needed: 20 IPs
   Business Impact: Cannot provision ingress IP, blocking HTTPS access to all 45 business domains.
                    Critical for customer acquisition, enterprise sales, and Fortune 500 partner access.
                    Platform completely inaccessible to external users.

3. STATIC_ADDRESSES (Global)
   Current Limit: 8
   Requested Limit: 15
   Justification: Reserved static IPs required for:
                  - Production ingress (currently reserved): 1
                  - Staging environment ingress: 2
                  - Regional endpoints (us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1): 3
                  - Partner integration endpoints (EY, JPMorgan, Google, Apple): 4
                  - Future multi-region expansion: 5
                  Current usage: 6/8 (75% - near limit)
   
4. INSTANCES (Regional - us-central1)
   Current Limit: Unknown
   Requested Limit: 30
   Justification: GKE cluster autoscaling requires ability to provision additional nodes.
                  Current state: 8 nodes (at capacity, cannot scale)
                  Production target: 25 nodes for enterprise workload
                  High availability buffer: 5 nodes for failover scenarios
                  Total: 30 instances needed

5. DISKS_TOTAL_GB (Regional - us-central1)
   Current Limit: 4096 GB (4 TB)
   Requested Limit: 10000 GB (10 TB)
   Justification: Persistent storage requirements for enterprise platform:
                  - PostgreSQL database volumes: 2 TB (user data, transactions)
                  - Knowledge graph storage (2,472 atoms + ML models): 1 TB
                  - Analytics and time-series data: 3 TB
                  - Automated backups and snapshots: 2 TB
                  - Growth buffer for 12 months: 2 TB
                  Total: 10 TB required

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
=================
- Product: AIA Enterprise Intelligence Platform
- Partnerships: Fortune 500 (EY Global $8.5M, JPMorgan Chase $12M, Google Cloud $3.5M, Apple $1M)
- Total Partnership Value: $25M
- Annual Recurring Revenue Potential: $75M
- Knowledge Processing: 2,472 AI knowledge atoms
- Business Domains: 45 domains requiring immediate HTTPS activation
- Compliance: German Grundgesetz (EU data residency requirements)
- User Base: Enterprise customers requiring 99.9% uptime SLA

CURRENT BLOCKER STATUS:
=======================
- 32 pods stuck in "Pending" state due to insufficient CPU
- Ingress cannot provision IP (8/8 quota exhausted)
- All 45 domains inaccessible via HTTPS
- SSL certificates failing (FailedNotVisible - no ingress IP)
- Platform deployment completed but cannot serve traffic
- Revenue generation completely blocked

TIMELINE: URGENT
================
Production deployment completed 2025-10-08 but cannot serve customers.
Every day of delay represents $1,667 in lost revenue ($50K/month).
Fortune 500 partners expecting platform availability immediately.
