# Legacy Knowledge Graph Archive - v2 Compressed

## Migration Date
2025-10-14

## Purpose
This directory contains archived legacy knowledge graph files that were replaced by the new atomic-DKG system.

## Archived Files
- `aia_knowledge_graph_compressed.json` - Original v2.0 compressed knowledge graph (2,472 atoms)
- `aia_knowledge_graph_compressed_backup.json` - Backup copy from development milestones

## Migration Details
- **From**: v2.0 compressed format with 2,472 knowledge atoms
- **To**: atomic-DKG-Full-GPU-M4Max-Maximum-Quality with 7,087,898+ atoms
- **Scale Improvement**: 2,870x more knowledge atoms
- **Reason**: Replaced by superior atomic knowledge graph system in `/atom-DKG/`

## Historical Context
These files were part of the earlier AIA knowledge graph implementation before the atomic-DKG system was developed with full M4 Max GPU optimization and comprehensive codebase analysis.

## Recovery
If needed for historical analysis, these files can be restored, but the new atomic-DKG system provides vastly superior knowledge coverage and processing capabilities.
